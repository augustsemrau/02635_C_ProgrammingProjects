# 02635_C_ProgrammingProjects
Two projects from the DTU course "02635 Mathematical Software Programming" written in C

## Project 1
The goal of project 1 was to use basic C programming for mathematical operations on vector and matrix.
- **Part 1** solves a system of equations by forward substitution.
- **Part 2** solves a triangular Sylvester equation by utilizing the function created for forward substitution in part 1.   


## Project 2
The goal of project 2 was to use an external libary, LAPACK, to solve systems of equations.

- **Part 1** utilizes the DGESV routine from LAPACK to solve a system of equations from a given matrix and vector.
- **Part 2** reads a matrix and vector from a .txt file and uses the DGESV routine from part 1 to solve the system and write the output to a new file c.txt.
